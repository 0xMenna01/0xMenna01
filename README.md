    👋 Hello there!
  </h1>
</div>


I hold a bachelor degree in computer engineering and I have a strong interest in both cybersecurity and blockchain. 
Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering while working on a project to explore the potential of the Polkadot ecosystem.

💻 I'm also learning Substrate and am fascinated by their potential for the blockchain industry.

🤝 Collaboration and continuous learning are at the core of my approach to this rapidly-evolving field. I always enjoy connecting with other like-minded individuals to exchange ideas and explore new opportunities.

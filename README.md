    👋 Hello there!
  </h1>
</div>


I hold a bachelor degree in computer engineering and I have a strong interest in both cybersecurity and blockchain. 
Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering while working on a project on the protocol level to explore the potential of the Polkadot ecosystem.
Polkadot is a blockhain system, that enables the parallel execution of different chains, known as parachains, that are interoperable with one another and have a shared security at the protocol level.

💻 I'm learning the Substrate framework and Ink!, a Rust EDSL for writing wasm smart contracts.

🤝 Collaboration and continuous learning are at the core of my approach to this rapidly-evolving field. I always enjoy connecting with other like-minded individuals to exchange ideas and explore new opportunities.

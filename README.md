I hold a bachelor degree in computer engineering and I have a strong interest in both cybersecurity and blockchain. 
Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in the field of cybersecurity while working on a project to explore the potential of the Polkadot ecosystem.

💻 I'm also learning Substrate and am fascinated by their potential for the blockchain industry.

🤝 Collaboration and continuous learning are at the core of my approach to this rapidly-evolving field. I always enjoy connecting with other like-minded individuals to exchange ideas and explore new opportunities.

🚀 If you share my passion for cybersecurity and blockchain, let's connect and see how we can create something awesome together!
